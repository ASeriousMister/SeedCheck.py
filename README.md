# SeedCheck.py
SeedCheck.py is a Python tool that tries  to determinate the derivation path a mnemonic seed was used with.
It is part of the bigger project Anuâ‚¿itux: more info at https://anubitux.org.
V2 relased: now user is able to decide how many addresses to derive and check.

## Overview
It allows the user to insert a mnemonic seed with an eventual passphrase and generates addresses with many derivation algorithms.
After deriving the addresses, it tries to look them up using apis of public block explorers, to verify if they were involved in transactions and determinate the correct derivation path. This feature is optional because users may not trust public block explorers and prefer to look up addresses in a different way.

## Tutorial
[Here](https://anubitux.org/find-out-how-a-seed-was-used-with-anubitux/) you can see how the tool works.

## Supported derivations
The tool supports the following coins with the indicated derivation paths:
### Bitcoin

## Installation
The tool was tested in Ubuntu 20.04 with Python3.8, Debian 11 with python 3.9 and Debian 12 with python 3.11. 
```
sudo apt update
```
and type
```
sudo apt install python3
```
Then install pip, to easily install the dependencies
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Now clone the github repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ASeriousMister/SeedCheck.py
```
and install python virtual environments
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```
Now move to SeedCheck.py's directory,
```
cd SeedCheck.py
```
create a virtual environment (in the example named scve, but you can choose your preferred name)
```
virtualenv scve
```
and activate it
```
source scve/bin/activate
```
The name of the virtual environment should appear, in brackets, on the left of your command line. 
Now you can install the dependencies:
```
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 libsecp256k1-0 python3-cryptography
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
In Debian 12 run
```
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 libsecp256k1-1 python3-cryptography protobuf-compiler
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Finally, you are ready to run the tool.
Sometimes pip may not install the packages listed in requirements.txt in the proper way.
In this case, just install the missing package shown in the error message with
```
pip3 install {missing_package_name}
```
## Running the tool
Finally, you are ready to run the tool.
The tool can be executed in normal mode. This way the tool is going to ask questions about the seed to check.
```
python3 seedcheck.py
```
The tool can also be executed providing a list of seeds to check (one for each line). It will iterate through the lines and automatically check all the seeds.
```
python3 seedchecklist.py -f /home/username/folder/list.txt
```

## Troubleshooting
The tool may encounter some issues running with Ubuntu 22.04, due to incompatibility with ripemd160 hashes used by the hdwallet library.
To solve this you need to edit the /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf file, making sure that it contains all the following lines:
```
openssl_conf = openssl_init

[openssl_init]
providers = provider_sect

[provider_sect]
default = default_sect
legacy = legacy_sect

[default_sect]
activate = 1

[legacy_sect]
activate = 1
```

## Additional tips
If you want to launch the tool as a single command in your terminal adding it to your PATH, you need to specify the tools folder changing the working directory of the tool in the seedcheck.py file. Go to line 16-17, edit the chdir command and uncomment it.

## Disclaimer
SeedCheck.py aims to help who finds a seed to determinate how it was used without the need of checking it with many clients. Of course, there are a lot of possibilities not handled by SeedCheck.py, so do not only rely of its output. There could be custom derivation paths used by skilled users or with some kind of client. The seed could also be related to different coins not checked by the tool.
When a derivation path is found, I suggest to try it with some kind of multicurrency client, because the mnemonic seed could derive addresses for many different coins.
